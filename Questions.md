The data in an instance store persists only during the lifetime of its associated
instance. If an instance is stopped or terminated, then the instance store does not persist.
Rebooting an instance does not shut down the instance; if an instance reboots
(intentionally or unintentionally), data on the instance store persists. Security groups
have nothing to do with the lifetime of an instance and have no effect here.
